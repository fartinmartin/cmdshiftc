### Customers by Andreas BjÃ¸rn Hansen

I recently came across this animation by Andreas BjÃ¸rn Hansen (an animator
at BUCK) and was curious how he created the illusion of a 3D cube to fit
the piece's 2D design aesthetic.

I soon found out it is deceptively simple in it's presentation. In this
article I am going to explain three ways that I was able to recreate
this animation, each solution increasing in difficulty but at the same
time allowing for more control.

The hope is by following each solution you can get a sense of how I went
about solving this problem. If you think that's unnecessary (totally
fair!) feel free to skip around, just know that each solution will start
from the initial setup found below. {{ðŸ‘ˆ link}} You may also grab the
starter file here. {{ðŸ‘ˆ link}}

### The breakdown

Let's break down the animation so that we have some common vocabulary.
Things might get a little complicated to follow later so these terms
will be our guide. ðŸ¤ 

To start, the animated cube consists of three sections; a top, a middle,
and a bottom.

\[GIF of separated & labels sections\]

It may also be worth noting that we only ever see three sides of each
section; a center, a right, and a left!

\[GIF of one section with each side labeled\]

Each side of each section is playing its own animation, so, in total
that's nine animations. In this article I won't be covering the
animations themselves, just the cube that presents them, but taking a
moment to think about their application will help us build out our
initial setup.

What do I mean by that? Well, we could imagine that each one of these
animations is not actually a dismembered body part of some being. There
isn't an animation of _just_ a head, or torso, or legs. Instead,
somewhere exists an animation of a complete, fully connected,
character---we are just seeing 1/3rd masked out.

"ghosted"\]

This is important because it determines how we will set up our project.
But before we get set up, let's simplify our problem a little, ya?

### Okay, let's simplify

Whoa, three sections with three sides each totalling nine animations
spinning around randomly is a lot to comprehend!

Luckily, if we look at our example again, we can see that each section
(top, middle, and bottom) are performing nearly identical animations.

So, for now, let's just forget about two of them, deal? Great. Once we
solve for one of the sections we can duplicate it (and offset the
timing) to achieve the final result.

### Let's get set up!

Just so we are on the same page, I am going to be recreating the middle
section. Feel free to start elsewhere, but know that some of the steps
will be specifically referring to the middle section and its properties
(its Position, Anchor Point, etc.)

What we are about to create are the three compositions that will house
our potential animations. For the sake of this article they will just
contain a background and a static number, but later you can drop
whatever you like inside.

As we talked about above {{ðŸ‘ˆ link}} these animations are of full
characters so while they look to be only 1/3rd of the cube's side they
should really be 100% of the cube's side, also known as a square, hehe!

If you'd like, you can also grab a starter file here {{ðŸ‘ˆ link}},
otherwise, here we go!

1.  Make a square composition named Side 01.
    - Its dimensions should be 1080x1080px
    - With a framerate of 30fps
    - And a duration of 5 seconds
2.  Add a Solid named Background.
    - Keyboard shortcut: Command + Y
    - Color it with a random color. _Note: for more flexibility color > your solids with a Fill effect._
3.  Add a Text Layer with the text 1.
    - Size it up to fill one third of the composition _Note: Option + > ' brings up your proportional grid which you can adjust by > going to the After Effects Preferences \> Grid & Guides... \> > Proportional Grid._
    - Center its position horizontally and vertically. _Note: you can > double click the text tool to create an automatically centered > text layer._
    - Optional: I am going to color my text white and set its blending > mode to Difference to ensure that it is always visible, no > matter what the background color is.
4.  Duplicated the Side 01 composition twice.
    - In your Project Panel, select the Side 01 composition and > hit Command + D twice. _Note: because our composition ended in > a number, After Effects will sequentially name our > compositions for us!_
    - It is a good idea to keep your Project Panel organized---make a > folder called Sides and drag + drop our three comps into > that folder.
5.  Change the background color and edit the text of both Side 02 and Side 03 compositions.
    - The text layer in Side 02 should read 2, etc.
6.  Create a new square composition named Master.
    - Its dimensions should be 2160x2160px
    - With a framerate of 30fps
    - And a duration of 5 seconds
    - In your Project Panel, make a folder called Main and drag + > drop our new Master composition into it.
7.  Drag + drop all three Side 0 compositions into the new Master composition.
8.  Mask each layer such that only the middle â…“ of each is visible.
    - Select the Side 01 layer and double click the Rectangle Tool > to create a mask that covers the whole layer.
    - Edit the mask to only reveal 1/3rd of the layer:
9.  Ya done! ðŸŽ‰
    - For now...

With our three sides made, organized, masked, and placed into our
Master composition, we can now construct our cube's middle section!
Just a reminder, there are three solutions

## The simple way: 3D Layers

\[GIF of final creation\]

### Intro + some caveats

In my first attempt to solve this I created a partial cube with 3D
layers and had them rotate around that cube's center point.

\[GIF of "Custom View 1"?\]

While this results in a neat animation it doesn't match the original in
a couple of ways. First, and most importantly, it doesn't respect the
original 2D design. Second, it is limited in the order in which each
side is revealed---we'll get more in depth on this limitation in a bit.

It is however, relatively quick to set up and is simple to control,
especially in comparison to the other two solutions. If that's your
style read on ahead, if not, skip to one of the other solutions!

### \[Steps\]

1.  Duplicate the Master composition from the starter file and rename it to 3D Layers.
2.  Inside of the 3D Layers composition, we need to offset each of our layer's Anchor Points:
    - To get a better sense of what is happening in 3D space, in the > Composition Panel, switch to Custom View 1
    - Select all three Side 0\_ layers, turn them into 3D layers > by clicking the 3D Layer switch
    - Hit A on your keyboard to reveal their Anchor Points
    - We want to place their Anchor Points exactly at the center point > of this imaginary cube that we are creating. That means we > need to take the "depth" of this cube and divide it in half. > Lucky for us, we know the "depth"---it's the same size as our > layer's height or width---so, 1080/2 = 540. TL;DM: the Z > value of each layer's anchor point should be 540
3.  Rotate each side on their Y axis into their "correct" position.
    - Select Side 01, hit R on your keyboard and rotate on the > Y axis 90Â°
    - Select Side 03, hit R on your keyboard and rotate on the > Y axis -90Â°
4.  Create a Null layer to be able to control all three layers as a group:
    - Keyboard shortcut: Shift + Option + Command + Y
    - Rename it Controller
    - Turn it 3D
    - Parent all three Side 0\_ layers to the new Controller > Null layer
5.  Animate the Controller Null's rotation on the Y axis.
    - In the Composition Panel, you may return to the "Active Camera" > view
    - Select the Controller Null layer and hit R on your > keyboard
    - On frame 10 set a keyframe for the Y Rotation
    - Hit Shift + Command + Right Arrow twice to move forward 20 > frames and set a keyframe at 90
    - Hit Shift + Command + Right Arrow three times to move forward 30 > frames and repeat those keyframes, this time in reverse (first > 90, then 30 frames later, 0).
    - You've got a loop!
6.  Now, to complete this animation you could...
    - Place your three complete character animations inside of the > Side 0\_ compositions.
    - Repeat (or duplicate!) this process for the top and bottom > sections.
    - Offset each section's Controller Null's rotation animations.
    - Add some easing > and...

ðŸ‘ˆ You might end up with something like this.

Okay, neat, but there are some problems. The biggest of which is that
this solution does not respect the 2D design language of the original!
(Worth repeating.)

Also, you can see through the cube at its corners while it rotates (this
[[can sort of be
solved]{.underline}](https://proloststore.com/products/edc), but
probably not worth it because... this solution does not respect the 2D
design language of the original!)

### \[Debrief\]

Also, we cannot break the order in which we reveal each face. That order
is built into the section of cube that we built with 3D layers (Side 01, then Side 02, then Side 03---or in reverse). In our
example however, (here, in the top section) we see Side 01, then
Side 02, then Side 03, then Side 01 without seeing Side 02 again!
