## The inspiration

I recently came across this animation by Andreas Bjørn Hansen (an animator
at BUCK) and was curious how he created the illusion of a 3D cube to fit
the piece's 2D design aesthetic.

I soon found out it is deceptively simple in it's presentation. In this
article I am going to explain three ways that I was able to recreate
this animation, each solution increasing in difficulty but at the same
time allowing for more control.

The hope is by following each solution you can get a sense of how I went
about solving this problem. If you think that's unnecessary (totally
fair!) feel free to skip around, just know that each solution will start
from the initial setup found in the introduction.

## The breakdown

Let's break down the animation so that we have some common vocabulary.
Things might get a little complicated to follow later so these terms
will be our guide. 🤠

To start, the animated cube consists of three sections; a top, a middle,
and a bottom.

![The cube's sections: top, middle, bottom](./media/sections.gif)

It may also be worth noting that we only ever see three sides of each
section; a center, a right, and a left!

![The section's sides: left, center, right](./media/sides.gif)

Each side of each section is playing its own animation, so, with
3 sections × 3 sides that makes nine animations in total.
In this article I won't be covering the animations themselves, just
the cube that presents them, but taking a moment to think about their
application will help us build out our initial setup.

What do I mean by that? Well, we could imagine that each one of these
animations is not actually a dismembered body part of some being. There
isn't an animation of _just_ a head, or torso, or legs. Instead,
somewhere exists an animation of a complete, fully connected,
character—we are just seeing 1/3rd masked out.

![A potetntial look at what the full-animation could be](./media/full-animation.gif)

This is important because it determines how we will set up our project.
But before we get set up, let's simplify our problem a little, ya?

### Okay, let's simplify

Whoa, three sections with three sides each totalling nine animations
spinning around randomly is a lot to comprehend!

Luckily, if we look at our example again, we can see that each section
(top, middle, and bottom) are performing nearly identical animations.

![](./media/image2.gif)

So, for now, let's just forget about two of them, deal? Great. Once we
solve for one of the sections we can duplicate it (and offset the
timing) to achieve the final result.

### Let's get set up!

Just so we are on the same page, to start with I am going to be recreating the middle
section. Feel free to start elsewhere, but know that some of the steps
will be specifically referring to the middle section and its properties
(its <Prop variant="ae">Position</Prop>, <Prop variant="ae">Anchor Point</Prop>, etc.)

First things first, we need to create the three compositions that will house
our potential animations. For the sake of this article they will just
contain a background and a static number, but later you can drop
whatever you like inside.

As we talked about [above](#the-breakdown) these animations are of full
characters so while they look to be only 1/3rd of the cube's side they
should really be 100% of the cube's side, also known as a square, hehe!

If you'd like, you can also grab a starter file here {{👈 TBD link}},
otherwise, here we go!

1.  Make a square composition named <Prop>Side 01</Prop>.
    - Its dimensions should be <Value>1080x1080px</Value>
    - With a framerate of <Value>30fps</Value>
    - And a duration of <Value>5</Value> seconds
2.  Add a Solid named Background.
    - Keyboard shortcut: ||Cmd|| + ||Y||
    - Color it with a random color. <Note>Note: for more flexibility color your solids with a Fill effect.</Note>
3.  Add a Text Layer with the text: <Value>1</Value>.
    - Size it up to fill one third of the composition
      <Note>
        Note: ||Option|| + ||'|| brings up your proportional grid which you can
        adjust by going to the After Effects Preferences > Grid & Guides... >
        Proportional Grid.
      </Note>
    - Center its position horizontally and vertically.
      <Note>
        Note: you can double click the text tool to create an automatically
        centered text layer.
      </Note>
    - Optional: I am going to color my text white and set its blending mode to Difference to ensure that it is always visible, no matter what the background color is.
4.  Duplicated the <Prop>Side 01</Prop> composition twice.
    - In your Project Panel, select the <Prop>Side 01</Prop> composition and hit Command + D twice.
      <Note>
        Note: because our composition ended in a number, After Effects will
        sequentially name our compositions for us!
      </Note>
    - It is a good idea to keep your Project Panel organized—make a folder called Sides and drag + drop our three comps into that folder.
5.  Change the background color and edit the text of both <Prop>Side 02</Prop> and <Prop>Side 03</Prop> compositions.
    - The text layer in <Prop>Side 02</Prop> should read <Value>2</Value>, etc.
6.  Create a new square composition named <Prop>Master</Prop>.
    - Its dimensions should be <Value>2160x2160px</Value>
    - With a framerate of <Value>30fps</Value>
    - And a duration of <Value>5</Value> seconds
    - In your Project Panel, make a folder called <Prop>Main</Prop> and drag + drop our new <Prop>Master</Prop> composition into it.
7.  Drag + drop all three <Prop>Side 0</Prop> compositions into the new Master composition.
8.  Mask each layer such that only the middle ⅓ of each is visible.
    - Select the <Prop>Side 01</Prop> layer and double click the Rectangle Tool to create a mask that covers the whole layer.
    - Edit the mask to only reveal 1/3rd of the layer:
9.  Ya done! 🎉
    - For now...

With our three sides made, organized, masked, and placed into our
Master composition, we can now construct our cube's middle section!
Just a reminder, there are three solutions

## The simple way

\[GIF of final creation\]

### Intro + some caveats

In my first attempt to solve this I created a partial cube with 3D
layers and had them rotate around that cube's center point.

\[GIF of "Custom View 1"?\]

While this results in a neat animation it doesn't match the original in
a couple of ways. First, and most importantly, it doesn't respect the
original 2D design. Second, it is limited in the order in which each
side is revealed---we'll get more in depth on this limitation in a bit.

It is however, relatively quick to set up and is simple to control,
especially in comparison to the other two solutions. If that's your
style read on ahead, if not, skip to one of the other solutions!

### \[Steps\]

1.  Duplicate the Master composition from the starter file and rename it to 3D Layers.
2.  Inside of the 3D Layers composition, we need to offset each of our layer's Anchor Points:
    - To get a better sense of what is happening in 3D space, in the Composition Panel, switch to Custom View 1
    - Select all three Side 0\_ layers, turn them into 3D layers by clicking the 3D Layer switch
    - Hit A on your keyboard to reveal their Anchor Points
    - We want to place their Anchor Points exactly at the center point of this imaginary cube that we are creating. That means we need to take the "depth" of this cube and divide it in half. Lucky for us, we know the "depth"---it's the same size as our layer's height or width---so, 1080/2 = 540. TL;DM: the Z value of each layer's anchor point should be 540
3.  Rotate each side on their Y axis into their "correct" position.
    - Select <Prop>Side 01</Prop>, hit R on your keyboard and rotate on the Y axis 90°
    - Select <Prop>Side 03</Prop>, hit R on your keyboard and rotate on the Y axis -90°
4.  Create a Null layer to be able to control all three layers as a group:
    - Keyboard shortcut: Shift + Option + Command + Y
    - Rename it Controller
    - Turn it 3D
    - Parent all three Side 0\_ layers to the new Controller Null layer
5.  Animate the Controller Null's rotation on the Y axis.
    - In the Composition Panel, you may return to the "Active Camera" view
    - Select the Controller Null layer and hit R on your keyboard
    - On frame 10 set a keyframe for the Y Rotation
    - Hit Shift + Command + Right Arrow twice to move forward 20 frames and set a keyframe at 90
    - Hit Shift + Command + Right Arrow three times to move forward 30 frames and repeat those keyframes, this time in reverse (first 90, then 30 frames later, 0).
    - You've got a loop!
6.  Now, to complete this animation you could...
    - Place your three complete character animations inside of the Side 0\_ compositions.
    - Repeat (or duplicate!) this process for the top and bottom sections.
    - Offset each section's Controller Null's rotation animations.
    - Add some easing and...

👈 You might end up with something like this.

Okay, neat, but there are some problems. The biggest of which is that
this solution does not respect the 2D design language of the original!
(Worth repeating.)

Also, you can see through the cube at its corners while it rotates (this
[[can sort of be
solved]{.underline}](https://proloststore.com/products/edc), but
probably not worth it because... this solution does not respect the 2D
design language of the original!)

### \[Debrief\]

Also, we cannot break the order in which we reveal each face. That order
is built into the section of cube that we built with 3D layers (<Prop>Side 01</Prop>, then <Prop>Side 02</Prop>, then <Prop>Side 03</Prop>---or in reverse). In our
example however, (here, in the top section) we see <Prop>Side 01</Prop>, then

<Prop>Side 02</Prop>, then
<Prop>Side 03</Prop>, then
<Prop>Side 01</Prop> without seeing
<Prop>Side 02</Prop> again!

What to do, what to do? 🤔

## The true to 2D way

[GIF of final creation]

### Intro + some caveats

This is because it’s not a cube—it just looks like one!

Instead, each face is a composition that is being scaled from one of its sides. Think of them as either left aligned or right aligned shapes. To complete the illusion of two sides of a cube making a 3D turn, as each face scales, they move out, and then back in.

![](./media/image5.gif)

This setup is not only a convincing 3D turn that respects the 2D design language of the original (!) but it also allows us to sequence the sides in whatever order we like. These advantages, however, will cost us in complexity! This solution will be slightly more complicated to build and to control. Totes worth it, though.

So, to reiterate, at it simplest this solution consists of two steps for each face:
Non-uniformly scale your layer from one side.
As it scales, move your layer out from the center, and then back in.

### Steps

Let's just focus on one "level". And more specifically, on one "face" of the "level" at a time. So, first we need to non-uniformly scale our layer:

1.  First, let’s duplicate our Master composition.
    - Rename the duplicate composition to Non-Uniformly Scaled Comps (or maybe something a little less nerdy) and double click to open it up.
2.  Set your anchor point to the edge of your initial "face" layer.
    - Select your initial "face" layer.
    - Hit Y on your keyboard.
    - Click and drag your layer's anchor point towards the left side of your layer.
    - Hold Command and it will snap to your layer's edge.
3.  Set an initial Scale keyframe.
    - Select your layer. Hit S on your keyboard.
    - Click the stopwatch.
4.  Set another Scale keyframe, this time with non-uniform proportions.
    - Move forward 20 frames (Shift + Page Down twice)
    - Unlink your scale proportions by clicking the link icon next to the blue text that says 100%, 100%.
    - Change the first value to 0%.
5.  Play back your animation and it now scales down to the left—we're halfway there!
6.  Now, set your anchor point to the edge of your second "face" layer.
    - This time the anchor point should be on the right.
7.  Apply the scale animation to the second “face” layer:
    - Copy your initial "face" layer's scale animation to this layer and then reverse them (Right Click > Keyframe Assistant > Time-reverse Keyframes).

Now our two layers scale non-uniformly in sync. But we need to move them out as they scale.

1.  Set start and end keyframes for the X Position of each "face" layer. These keyframes should be in sync with the previous Scale keyframes you made.
2.  In the middle of all these keyframes move the initial "face" layer to the left 100px and the second "face" layer to the right 100px.
3.  Oop, now there is a gap as they scale! Not to worry.
4.  In the middle keyframe adjust your scale values of each layer so that they meet in the middle of the gap.
5.  Now add some easing to the start and end keyframes and set the middle keyframes to auto-bezier. Should be pretty close.

### Debrief

Much better, right? But we could get more precise, right? And we could do this “non-destructively” so that we could swap in any video, animation, or image in any of the sides? Yeah, a little rig, that would be neat...
