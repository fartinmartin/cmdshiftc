Hit <Key>S</Key> on your keyboard to bring up the <Prop variant="ae">Scale</Prop> property. Set the value to <Value variant="ae">97%</Value>.

1. First, let’s duplicate our `Master` comp.
   - Rename the duplicate comp to `3D Layers` and double click to open it up.
2. Set your anchor point to the edge of your initial "face" layer.
3. Set an initial Scale keyframe.
4. Set another Scale keyframe, this time with non-uniform proportions.
5. Play back your animation and it now scales down to the left—we're halfway there!
6. Now, set your anchor point to the edge of your second "face" layer.
7. Apply the scale animation to the second “face” layer
